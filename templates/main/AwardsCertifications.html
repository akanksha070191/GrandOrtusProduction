          Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection
          ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is an international standard that provides a systematic framework for managing
          information security within an organization.

          Grand Ortus implemented all necessary steps to comply with this standard. Accredited and authorised
          auditors performed assessments of the organisation’s ISMS to confirm its complete compliance with
          the ISO 27001:2022 requirements. The ISO 27001:2022 award certifies that Grand Ortus can thoroughly
          evaluate or identify risks and that appropriate measures are in place to handle or minimise them.
          The breadth of Grand Ortus certification ensures continuity of data stewardship through the entire
          service delivery process.

          With this certification, Grand Ortus clients can rest assured that they are working with a reliable
          Information Technology Development & service provider dedicated to protecting the integrity of their
          sensitive data and operating according to internationally acknowledged guidelines.
