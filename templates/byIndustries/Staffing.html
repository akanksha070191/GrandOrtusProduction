                    <strong>How IT Transforms the Staffing and Recruitment Industry:</strong>
                    <p> Information technology (IT) is transforming the staffing and recruitment industry by streamlining hiring processes, improving candidate matching, and enhancing operational efficiency. IT tools like Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) automate candidate sourcing, resume screening, and interview scheduling, significantly reducing administrative workload. AI and machine learning algorithms help match candidates to job roles based on skills, experience, and cultural fit, leading to better recruitment outcomes. Video interview platforms and online assessments enable remote recruitment, expanding the talent pool globally.
