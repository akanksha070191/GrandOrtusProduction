                        <p>IT enables electronic health records (EHRs), facilitating seamless data sharing among healthcare providers 
                            for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Telemedicine platforms expand access to care, connecting patients and 
                            doctors remotely. Advanced data analytics help in predictive modeling, improving patient outcomes, and 
                            optimizing resource allocation. Technologies like AI and machine learning assist in diagnostics, drug 
                            development, and personalized medicine, while IoT devices monitor patient health in real time. IT continues 
                            to shape a more connected, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare ecosystem.

            <strong>Electronic Health Records (EHRs):</strong>
            <div>
                <p>These digital repositories of patient data allow for secure and centralized access to medical
                    history, medications, allergies, and immunizations. This eliminates the need for paper charts and
                    reduces the risk of errors, improving patient safety and continuity of care.</p>
