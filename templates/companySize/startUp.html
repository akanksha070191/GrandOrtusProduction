                <p class="role-description">Designing scalable systems that evolve with the startup's growth.
                    Integrators plan for future needs by building modular and adaptable infrastructures. They ensure the
                    startup can integrate additional features, users, or data volumes without significant reengineering,
                    helping to maintain cost-efficiency over time.</p>
