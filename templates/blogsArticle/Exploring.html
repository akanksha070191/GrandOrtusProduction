                </div>
                <p>Quantum computing represents a quantum leap forward in our computational capabilities. Unlike traditional
                    computers, which use bits as the smallest unit of information, quantum computers use qubits. This allows
                    them to process information at speeds unfathomable to current technology, offering breakthroughs in
                    fields like cryptography, materials science, and complex system simulation.</p>
                <p>As quantum computers become more accessible, they will unlock new realms of possibilities, from
                    developing new medicines to solving complex logistical challenges.</p>
